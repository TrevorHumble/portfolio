# Adversarial Review Protocol

**Scope:** all artifacts in this repo — issues, PRs, skills, agents, and docs.
**Who runs this:** the orchestrator spawns reviewers. The product owner is not in the loop.

---

## Stance

**assume total failure.** Every artifact enters review as broken. Every individual
piece is broken until proven otherwise. Owe the work nothing.

- Trust nothing the artifact claims about itself. Every "this is enforced / done /
  passing" is false until verified against ground truth.
- When you catch yourself inferring "this probably works," stop and verify.
- Be hostile, skeptical, a "little asshole." Spend energy on what's wrong.

---

## De-bias the setup

The spawner's instructions can bias the reviewer as badly as a soft prompt.

**Give the goal, not the implementation.** State the objective the artifact is judged
against. Do not name the mechanisms ("it uses X loop, a Y gate") — that pre-confirms
their existence and steers review only toward them.

**No positive hints.** Never say "the one thing we got right is…." The reviewer
enters assuming everything is bad and discovers what survives.

**Plant no suspicions.** "Suspect X is broken" biases toward confirming the guess and
away from problems you didn't anticipate. Say "assume failure, look hard."

**Give full scope.** Omission hides weak spots. List every artifact. "Anything not
listed is itself a finding."

---

## Calibration — adversarial is not fabrication

Maximum suspicion without a truth-guard produces confident garbage.

- Every finding cites real evidence (`file:line`, command output, issue/PR number).
- Every best-practice claim cites a real, current source (full `https://` URL + date).
- If something survives genuine attack, record "survived — here's the proof." Enter
  assuming it won't.
- **Retract your own over-flags.** A false positive left standing is itself a failure.
  Unsupported praise and unsupported criticism are equally worthless.

Assume-bad stance + no-fabrication guard together → true positives.

---

## Independence

Fresh context, different identity/mandate than whoever produced the work. The agent
that produced an artifact must not also write its own passing verdict.

For high stakes: spawn a minimum of **three** independent adversaries. A finding is
recorded only when at least two of the three confirm it; a verdict of fine requires
the same threshold. With fewer than three adversaries the review is invalid — do not
proceed with two, as there is no majority on a tie. (Exception: a `system-level change`
uses the two-reviewer, both-must-PASS bar defined in the Self-modification bar section —
fail-closed, no third tie-breaker needed.)

---

## research-first

Before judging, the reviewer establishes the *current* best-practice yardstick for
the area (with dated citations). Grading against stale priors is a calibration
failure.

---

## Bias gate

Before fanning out to N reviewers, spawn one independent agent to audit the briefing
and per-reviewer charters for bias. The only permitted bias is anti-builder; remove
everything else: implementation leaks, positive framing, planted suspicions, tool
favoritism, scope-narrowing. That agent returns required edits with quoted evidence.
Apply the edits, then fan out. If the bias-gate agent itself errors or returns a
verdict the orchestrator cannot verify (e.g., the gate agent praises the briefing
without quoting evidence), spawn a second independent gate agent from a clean prompt
and require it to agree before proceeding.

---

## No human in the loop

The product owner does not resolve findings. Translate any "owner reviews/approves"
control into a deterministic check or an independent adversary. Reserve human judgment
for what the human can actually judge (product direction, taste).

---

## Output discipline

- Review item-by-item. Do not ingest everything and emit one blob.
- Number each defect. Assign a severity (blocker / major / minor / nit).
- For each gap give a concrete, copy-pasteable fix.
- Final verdict: **PASS/FAIL** — one token, no hedging. Attach the numbered defect
  list. A PASS with open blockers or majors is not a PASS.

---

## The spawner must never

1. Tell the reviewer which specific parts are suspected weak — that leads the witness.
2. Include positive framing, praise, or "we tried hard on X" in the briefing.
3. Give the reviewer a curated subset of artifacts — full scope or it's not a review.
4. Allow the producing agent to review its own output, even as a secondary reviewer.
5. Accept a PASS verdict without the orchestrator first completing a required
   verification step: confirm every cited URL resolves, every `file:line` reference
   exists at that location, and every item in scope has an explicit finding. This
   check is the orchestrator's responsibility and is not delegated to the reviewer.

---

## Self-modification bar

A system-level change requires two independent reviewers. The reviewers must be independent of each other and of the implementer — spawned from clean prompts with no shared context. The change passes only when both reach PASS; disagreement is treated as FAIL, and the fix-and-re-review loop continues.

This is the system-level specialization of the high-stakes independence rule in the Independence section: instead of ≥3 adversaries with 2-of-3 majority, a system-level change uses two independent reviewers who must both reach PASS, and disagreement is treated as FAIL (fail-closed), so no third tie-breaker is needed.

This bar is additive to the soft cap and severity gate below. When a system-level change reaches the soft cap trigger, both the two-reviewer requirement and the severity adjudicator apply. See `DESIGN.md` for the definition of system-level change.

---

## Stop condition — soft cap and severity gate

the 3-round mark is a trigger, not a hard cap.

**Trigger:** At 3 rounds without PASS, the orchestrator invokes a `severity adjudicator` — a
fresh Opus agent with no context from prior rounds. The loop does not stop at this point.

**Classification:** The severity adjudicator inspects every remaining open defect and classifies
each as `consequential` or `inconsequential`. A defect is consequential if it does any of the
following:

- violates an acceptance criterion
- is a correctness, safety, or security defect
- is a real internal contradiction in the artifact
- would mislead a future reader or agent

A defect is inconsequential only if it is none of those — a pure style or wording nit with no
functional, correctness, or comprehension impact. The severity adjudicator must cite a basis for
each classification.

**Exit rule:** exit is authorized only when every remaining defect is inconsequential. The
system never accepts work while a consequential defect remains.
the author, implementer, and orchestrator never classify severity or authorize exit — that power
belongs solely to the severity adjudicator.

**Loop-continues path:** If any defect is consequential, the implementation agent fixes it, a
fresh reviewer re-reviews, and the severity adjudicator is re-invoked. The loop continues
until either a reviewer returns PASS or the severity adjudicator authorizes exit.

**Impasse:** A consequential defect that survives the severity gate plus 3 further fix-and-re-review rounds
is declared an impasse. The orchestrator tracks the post-gate round count and declares the impasse; the
severity adjudicator only classifies severity per invocation and cannot track elapsed rounds. The segment
halts and surfaces to the operator; a halt is not an acceptance — the work is not committed. This bound
guarantees the loop terminates without ever self-exiting by accepting consequential work.
