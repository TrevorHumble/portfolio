# Writing a doc

**Standard:** `standards/documentation-standards.md` — read it; do not restate it here.

## Consumer POV

Name the consumer before writing a word. Format: `As a [consumer], I need… so that….` If you cannot name a consumer, the doc has no purpose. Write for that consumer, not for the author.

## File routing

| File | Contains |
|------|----------|
| `DESIGN.md` | Architecture decisions, rationale, tradeoffs |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Behavioral rules for the AI operating in this repo |
| `README.md` | Getting-started and reference for human users |

Do not mix. Wrong file = wrong reader.

## Acceptance criteria must be literal

Every AC for a doc must resolve to a literal string or structural check: present/absent phrase, section header, file path, token count. No criterion of the form "a reader can understand X" — that is unfalsifiable. Rewrite as: "the file contains the phrase `X`" or "section Y exists."

## Anti-bloat

- No preamble ("This document aims to…").
- No restatement of the section header in the opening sentence.
- If a section can be one line, make it one line.
- Bloat is a defect only when a reviewer can quote the specific sentence removable without loss of meaning.

## Naming

No FINAL, LAST, TRULY_FINAL in filenames or section headers. Use versions (`v1`, `v2`), timestamps (`2026-06-15`), or descriptive deltas.

## Currency

Update the doc when any interface it describes changes, any decision is reversed, or any downstream artifact contradicts a claim it makes. Stale docs produce false confidence.
