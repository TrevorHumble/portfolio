# Capturing a system defect

When you notice a defect in the repo's own machinery during a run, do not silently work around it.
File it. This skill produces a correctly-tiered issue and returns you to the current task.

## Step 1 — identify and describe the defect

Write a one-paragraph description covering:
- what the defect is (observable behavior, not a guess about root cause)
- which artifact is affected (`skills/`, `agents/`, `standards/`, or a process step)
- what triggered the observation

## Step 2 — determine tier and action

**fix-now:** the defect blocks the current task's correctness or safety and cannot be worked
around without compromising the deliverable. Pause the current task; fix through the pipeline;
resume. A fix-now issue is filed as `ready` and must meet the full ready-tier checklist in
`standards/issue-standards.md` (user story, Given/When/Then acceptance criteria, an implementation
plan with at least three numbered steps, and the Depends/Blocks/Touches dependency map).

**backlog:** everything else. File the issue and continue. The current task does not pause.

Tier is declared in the issue's `**Type:**` line. Consult `standards/issue-standards.md` for
the full tier definitions and required fields for each tier — do not restate them here.

## Step 3 — draft the issue

Use `skills/issue-create.md`. File the issue in `issues/NNNN-*.md` with:
- a user story naming the agent or human hurt by the defect
- at least one Given/When/Then acceptance criterion that resolves to a literal string or
  structural check (even at backlog tier)
- for a backlog issue: the graduation-condition field required by `standards/issue-standards.md`
  (deterministic, not human-approval)

Assign the next available four-digit number. Do not reuse or skip numbers.

## Step 4 — return to the current task

After filing, resume the interrupted task. The captured issue enters the pipeline on its next
scheduled segment. No separate escalation step is needed unless the issue is fix-now.
